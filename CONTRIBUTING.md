# Contributing to Serpentity

At this moment this is a pet project and not really thought out a lot,
it may not be that active but I appreciate any contribution.

## The objective of serpentity

It's an entity-component-system library for node. A goal is to
be bare but extendable: You can create reusable components that can be
shared with other serpentity users, but they should live outside of the
core. Any improvements to performance and testing welcome.

## How to contribute

Above All: Be nice, always.

* Ensure the linter shows no warnings or errors
* Don't break the CI
* Make the PRs according to [Git Flow][gitflow]: (features go to
  develop, hotfixes go to master)
